###1. Acceptance of the Terms of Service
Welcome to **Augeo**! (a.k.a. "**we**" or "**us**" or the "**Company**"). We are excited to have you as a user and member of the community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "**Terms of Service**") apply to your use of www.augeo.io, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via Augeo.io (the "**Website**"). The Terms of Service also include our **Privacy Policy**, that you can review here: https://github.com/bpred754/augeo/blob/master/privacy-policy.md

We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using Augeo, because **by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service**. 

Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can leave the Website (although we'll be sad to see you go!).

###2. Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website
Augeo is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. We will make sure to announce any major change in a prominent way, but since "major" is a very subjective concept, you can always monitor the changes at our application [repository](https://github.com/bpred754/augeo). Of course, this document is public on Augeo, and you will be able to see the changes for any new version. **Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes**.

###3. Accessing the Website, Security and Privacy
We are working hard on improving Augeo, but we can't guarantee that the Website will be up and running 24/7. We also reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also section 7 below).

To access certain features of the Website you have to register by entering your email and choosing a password as part of our security procedures. You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Augeo in person. We highly recommend to choose a strong password and that you log out from your account at the end of every session.

It is a condition of your use of the Website that all the information you provide on the Website is correct, current and complete. In the future, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. As custom for internet websites, we reserve the right to disable any user account, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Service.

We also do not guarantee that the Website or any content provided on the Website is error free. We manage your personal data according to our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/bpred754/augeo/blob/master/privacy-policy.md).
