###Augeo
A web application that gives you the power to view your interests in a quantitative way. It's common sense... the more you do something the better you become. In this case, we categorize your online activity into different skills and award experience depending on the activity type. As your experience grows, you will gain levels and be ranked among other [Augeo](https://www.augeo.io) users. Although the current application only takes Twitter and Github activity into consideration, the [vision](https://github.com/bpred754/augeo/wiki/Vision) for [Augeo](https://www.augeo.io) is much larger. Our intention is to expand to a vast set of interfaces, from other sites and blogs to health related apps such as FitBit. The possibilities are endless. In a nutshell, Augeo is the gamification of life.

###Who should join?
You! Even if you don't consider yourself a front-runner in your field of interest/work, it's a part of [Augeo](https://www.augeo.io/login)'s [vision](https://github.com/bpred754/augeo/wiki/vision) to incorporate a portal for people with similar passions to connect. Not only can you connect with like-minded people, the concept of gamification introduces some friendly competition. Now, you will be more motivated than ever to expand your knowledge and skills to out rank your friends.

Not the competitive type? That's okay! [Augeo](https://www.augeo.io/login) is also a perfect place for finding leaders in topics that most fascinate you. Want to find out about the top people talking about sports? Just head over to the [leaderboards](https://www.augeo.io/leaderboards) section and filter by 'Sports'. It's that simple!

###Vision
As mentioned before, the idea is for [Augeo](https://www.augeo.io/login) to expand to several different interfaces, including other social media platforms, blogs, and even IOT devices. Due to Twitter's robust developers API, it was the first to be introduced into the [Augeo](https://www.augeo.io/login) platform. This is mentioned since it is not our only intention to capture social media activity. Our mission is to best represent a persons skill set and knowledge by leveraging the mass amounts of data we produce every day.
